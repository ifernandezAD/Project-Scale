## Gameplay

In **Absorbliss**, you take on the role of a tiny black hole, guided by a mysterious cosmic entity. Your mission is simple yet challenging: absorb as many objects as possible within a limited time to grow and ultimately satiate the hunger of the void.

Starting small, you'll navigate through diverse environments filled with mundane objects like farms, houses, and vehicles. As you absorb more, your size and gravitational pull increase, allowing you to consume even larger structures. But be quick and strategic â€” you have only 3 minutes to achieve ultimate absorption!

## Features

- **Dynamic Growth Mechanics:** Start as a minuscule singularity and expand exponentially as you absorb objects around you.
- **Time-Based Challenges:** Race against the clock to achieve the largest size possible within the time limit.
- **Intuitive Controls:** Smooth and responsive controls make navigating and absorbing objects satisfying and fun.
- **Physics-Based Interactions:** Realistic physics provide a satisfying feel as objects react and collapse into your black hole.
- **Vibrant Environments:** Explore richly detailed and colorful landscapes filled with a variety of absorbable objects.
- **Engaging Soundtrack:** An immersive and energetic soundtrack enhances the gameplay experience.
- **Performance Optimizations:** Optimized for smooth performance across different systems and platforms.
