Gameplay
In Absorbliss, you take on the role of a tiny black hole, guided by a mysterious cosmic entity. Your mission is simple yet challenging: absorb as many objects as possible within a limited time to grow and ultimately satiate the hunger of the void.

Starting small, you'll navigate through diverse environments filled with mundane objects like farms, houses, and vehicles. As you absorb more, your size and gravitational pull increase, allowing you to consume even larger structures. But be quick and strategic â€” you have only 3 minutes to achieve ultimate absorption!

Features
Dynamic Growth Mechanics: Start as a minuscule singularity and expand exponentially as you absorb objects around you.
Time-Based Challenges: Race against the clock to achieve the largest size possible within the time limit.
Intuitive Controls: Smooth and responsive controls make navigating and absorbing objects satisfying and fun.
Physics-Based Interactions: Objects realistically react as they are pulled into your black hole.

Technical Details
Absorbliss was developed using the Unity game engine over the course of a 3-day game jam. The project is a testament to what can be achieved in a short time frame, though it also comes with its share of technical limitations.

Technologies and Tools
Unity Engine: Utilized for 3D rendering and physics.
C# Scripting: Core game mechanics and systems implemented using C#.
Unity's Physics System: Handles object interactions and gravitational pull.
Version Control: Managed with Git during development.
Performance Considerations
Given the time constraints of the 3-day jam, the game has some areas that could be optimized further:

Efficient Collision Detection: Simple colliders and basic collision detection are used to keep performance manageable.
Dynamic Rigidbody Assignment: Rigidbodies are dynamically added to objects only when necessary, helping to reduce physics calculations.
Basic Collider Use: Basic colliders are used throughout the project to minimize processing overhead.
Despite these measures, the game may experience performance issues on lower-end systems, especially in the final stages of gameplay when many objects are on screen.

Disclaimer
Absorbliss was created as part of a game jam, with all its development done in just 3 days. While the game is fully functional, it is not as optimized as it could be, particularly regarding performance on less powerful hardware and in web builds. Future updates may address these issues, but they are present in the current version.
